 * Calculates hours worked from iCal calendars.
 * Uses the length of an event to calculate the time worked.
 * Treats all-day events as 8 hours.
   * Starting an all-day event's name with a number will use that number as the number of hours for the event rather than the default 8.
   * All-day events that span multiple days are *not* supported.
 * Shows daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, and all-time roll-ups for each calendar.
 * In addition to rolling up for each calendar, it gives a roll-up of the total hours worked for the given period (day, week, month, year).
 * Additionally it provides a _Percentage Worked_ summary for the period to show the percentage of time you've worked for that period (calculated as 8 hours a day for 5 days a week).
 * Supports non-local calendars (e.g. Google Calendar).
   * Delegate calendars are not currently supported.
 * Allows you to specify expected hours each day of the week (used for calculating percentage worked).
 * (For the weekly view) Lets you specify the day your weeks start (e.g. Mon - Sun vs Sun - Sat).
